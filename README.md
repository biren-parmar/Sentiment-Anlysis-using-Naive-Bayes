# Sentiment-Anlysis-using-Naive-Bayes

In this project, sentiment analyzer is implemented using term frequency based Multi-nomial Naïve Bayes classifier, and binarized Naïve Bayes . It can classify documents based on the sentiments ‘positive’ or ‘negative’. Following results were achieved:
* MN Naïve Bayes:
    * Frequency Based(With Stop Words): Average Accuracy:0.794920, F1score: 0.783943
    * Frequency Based(Without Stop Words): Average Accuracy: 0.795440, F1score: 0.783955
    * MN Binarized Naïve Bayes: Average 0.800040, F1score: 0.785173
